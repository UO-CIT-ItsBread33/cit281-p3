# Welcome to the Cit 281 Project 3 Page

### What I learned:

- Gained experience using Fastify servers.
- Worked on interpreting descriptions of what a desired function is supposed to do.
- Practiced having web servers output results from functions on another file. 
- Gained experience importing and exporting functions from another file.
- Gained experience using routes and query parameters. 

### Purpose of Project:

- This project helped us work with web servers and having functions output to the web server, which results in displaying it on the browser.
- Also helped us work on importing and exporting code from another file.
- This project also helped us further work with arrays and objects. 
- We also got to work with obtaining information from the url which can be used to output different results from functions.
